## Speed dating experiment
Try to understand love, namely what happens during a speed dating experiment.

## Goal to be achieved
- Do a descriptive analysis of the provided dataset
- Verify the hypothesis which states that there is a decrease in self-esteem of the participants from sign-up time to 3-4 weeks after a speed dating session.

## Methodology applied to reach the goal
- Build a data dictionary to understand the subtleties of the dataset
- Try to understand how data was collected and organized throughout the whole process
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Some simple data preprocessing
- Extraction of relevant columns and data manipulation to test the initial hypothesis

## Conclusion
There is a decrease in self-esteem of the participants from sign-up time to 3-4 weeks after a speed dating session: this hypothesis has been tested and confirmed.
To reach this conclusion, missing values of the columns of interest have been replaced by zero in the dataset. This operation allowed me to work with the dataset in a simpler way. Real life situations are more complex. In this prticular example, if possible, it would have been useful to contact the persons who collected the data at different stages of the experiment to better understand the data.
